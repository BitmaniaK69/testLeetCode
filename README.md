# testLeetCode

This is a summary of my tests on leetcode.
Where was possible I used C++ constructs that I love more, 
but sometimes is harder think in old style too (eg: the arrays tests).

It's a very interesting challenge, 
to make it more funny, 
I'm trying to solve as much exercises in one day (more than a week).
